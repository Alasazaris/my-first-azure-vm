My First Windows VM in Azure

Objective - This project demonstrates how I created and managed a Windows virtual machine in Microsoft Azure to understand the fundamentals of cloud infrastructure.

Steps Completed:
- Created a Resource Group in Azure  
- Deployed a Windows Server 2022 Virtual Machine  
- Allowed RDP access (Port 3389)  
- Connected to the VM using Remote Desktop (RDP)  
- Installed IIS Web Server role  
- Created a test file inside the VM

** Azure Hotpatch is a feature available in Windows Server 2022 Azure Edition 
that allows security patches to be applied without rebooting the virtual machine. 
It reduces downtime, improves security by enabling faster patch deployment, and 
is ideal for production workloads where uptime is critical.**
